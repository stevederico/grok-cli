Grok CLI is an open-source interactive CLI tool that provides a flexible and powerful interface for AI-assisted workflows.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm i -g @stevederico/grok-cli
grok
```

## Environment Variables

### Provider Configuration

| Provider | Environment Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|---------|

## Examples

Once the CLI is running, you can start interacting with AI models from your shell.

You can start a project from a new directory:

```sh
cd new-project
grok
> Write me a Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

Or work with an existing project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stevederico/skateboard
cd skateboard
grok
> Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday
```
