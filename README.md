## Environment Variables

### Provider Configuration

| Provider | Environment Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| Grok (xAI) | `XAI_API_KEY` | API key for Grok AI | `export XAI_API_KEY="your_grok_api_key"` |
| Grok (xAI) | `XAI_MODEL` | Specific Grok model to use | `export XAI_MODEL="grok-4-0709"` |
| Ollama | `OLLAMA_HOST` | Ollama server endpoint | `export OLLAMA_HOST="http://localhost:11434"` |

### General Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `GROK_CLI_PROVIDER` | Set the default AI provider | `grok` | `export GROK_CLI_PROVIDER="ollama"` |

## Quickstart

1. **Prerequisites:** Install [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Provider:**
   Set your preferred LLM provider's API key or local endpoint

   ```bash
   # For Grok
   export XAI_API_KEY="your_grok_api_key"

   # For Ollama (local inference)
   export OLLAMA_HOST="http://localhost:11434"
   ```

4. **Start the CLI:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Pick a color theme**

## Examples

Once the CLI is running, you can start interacting with AI models from your shell.

You can start a project from a new directory:

```sh
cd new-project
> Write me a Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

Or work with an existing project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stevederico/grok-cli
cd grok-cli
grok
> Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday
```
