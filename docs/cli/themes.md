# Themes

Grok CLI supports two themes: Light and Dark. You can change the theme via the `/theme` command or the `"theme":` configuration setting.

## Available Themes

- **Dark Theme**
- **Light Theme**

### Changing Themes

1. Enter `/theme` into Grok CLI.
2. Select either `Light` or `Dark` from the prompt.
3. Confirm your selection to apply the theme.

### Theme Persistence

Selected themes are saved in Grok CLI's [configuration](./configuration.md) so your preference is remembered across sessions.
