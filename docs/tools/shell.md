# Shell Tool (`run_shell_command`)

This document describes the `run_shell_command` tool for the Grok CLI.

## Description

Use `run_shell_command` to interact with the underlying system, run scripts, or perform command-line operations. `run_shell_command` executes a given shell command. On Windows, the command will be executed with `cmd.exe /c`. On other platforms, the command will be executed with `bash -c`.

### Arguments

`run_shell_command` takes the following arguments:

- `command` (string, required): The exact shell command to execute.
- `description` (string, optional): A brief description of the command's purpose, which will be shown to the user.
- `directory` (string, optional): The directory (relative to the project root) in which to execute the command. If not provided, the command runs in the project root.

## How to use `run_shell_command` with the Grok CLI

When using `run_shell_command`, the command is executed as a subprocess. `run_shell_command` can start background processes using `&`. The tool returns detailed information about the execution, including:

- `Command`: The command that was executed.
- `Directory`: The directory where the command was run.
- `Stdout`: Output from the standard output stream.
- `Stderr`: Output from the standard error stream.
- `Error`: Any error message reported by the subprocess.
- `Exit Code`: The exit code of the command.
- `Signal`: The signal number if the command was terminated by a signal.
- `Background PIDs`: A list of PIDs for any background processes started.

Usage:

```
run_shell_command(command="Your commands.", description="Your description of the command.", directory="Your execution directory.")
```

## `run_shell_command` examples

List files in the current directory:

```
run_shell_command(command="ls -la")
```

Run a script in a specific directory:

```
run_shell_command(command="./my_script.sh", directory="scripts", description="Run my custom script")
```

Start a background server:

```
run_shell_command(command="npm run dev &", description="Start development server in background")
```

## Important notes

- **Security:** Be cautious when executing commands, especially those constructed from user input, to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- **Interactive commands:** Avoid commands that require interactive user input, as this can cause the tool to hang. Use non-interactive flags if available (e.g., `npm init -y`).
- **Error handling:** Check the `Stderr`, `Error`, and `Exit Code` fields to determine if a command executed successfully.
- **Background processes:** When a command is run in the background with `&`, the tool will return immediately and the process will continue to run in the background. The `Background PIDs` field will contain the process ID of the background process.
